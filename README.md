# CineBrain
CineScope AI is a powerful Django + PostgreSQL RESTful API that delivers structured data from the IMDb dataset along with intelligent insights powered by large language models (LLMs). It allows users to search and explore detailed movie information, while also generating AI-based summaries, genre analysis, and thematic breakdowns for each movie.
